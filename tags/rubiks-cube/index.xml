      <description>The Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube, invented in 1974 by Ern≈ë Rubik, is the most sold puzzle of all time. Me, being born on 1994, am 20 years younger than the puzzle. And as most children of my age, I got my first cube and had no clue how to solve it. For many years, the only way was to disassemble it and put it back together. That changed when I started studying computer science in 2012.</description>
