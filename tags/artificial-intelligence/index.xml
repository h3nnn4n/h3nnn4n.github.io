      <title>Smart Panda - A Tetris Playground for AIs</title>

      <description>Smart Panda is a simple Tetris Playground intended for use with Artificial Intelligences. That is, the intended use of Smart Panda is as a Tetris engine to explore and apply some Artificial Intelligence concepts to Tetris. The core of Smart Panda is written in rust, compiled to wasm using wasm-pack and wasm-bindgen. What you see happening on the browser right now is controlled with JavaScript. That is, the heavy lifting is made in rust and javascript does some glue logic and calls the update events from Smart Panda.</description>

      <description>Starcraft 2 is currently the most competitive 1 vs 1 game, and from a Artificial Intelligence point of view it is a good (and hard) problem to tackle. It is very complex, having very delayed rewards, high dimensionality, volatility (baneling hit = rip), partial information and other things. Recently Blizzard shared an interface that makes possible for agents to play the game.
DeepMind is probably the leading research force on Starcraft 2 right now on a professional level.</description>
