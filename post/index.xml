      <description>After writing a bit about the original Dancing with Friends and Enemies and my reimplementation I decided to try to implement something more close to the original. The first version used matter.js which added a different behavior style to the particles while being somewhat similar to the original.
 I was satisfied with the results and glad to be able to keep its original behavior while adding my own touch to it.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I found a thread on the Wolfram forum about swarm intelligence and emergent behavior, two things that I enjoy a lot. The title of the thread was something like &amp;ldquo;Dancing With Friends and Enemies&amp;rdquo; and it does not exist anymore as far as I can tell. However, I was able to find a copy here. The idea is pretty simple and below you can see my reinterpretation of it.</description>

      <title>Flow field</title>

      <description>One of the most popular coding exercises out there is a Flow Field. The main idea behind that is to generate a vector field randomly, which is very often based on Perlin Noise. Then a set of particles are placed on the vector field and they are free to move along it, where the vector field determines the force placed upon the particle. To make things more dynamic and alive it is possible to vary the vector field over time.</description>

      <description>Hey there. Recentlty I started working at JobScore while I was working at my masters degree on Applied Computing. This marked a new stage of my life. One that I am not familiar with, since I just graduated and never worked before. One of my main fears when I started working was stop evolving as a person and as an employee. With that in mind, I took a few commitments with the goal of creating healthy and productive habbits for my new life:</description>

      <title>Starcraft 2 Stalker Micro</title>

      <description>Starcraft 2 is currently the most competitive 1 vs 1 game, and from a Artificial Intelligence point of view it is a good (and hard) problem to tackle. It is very complex, having very delayed rewards, high dimensionality, volatility (baneling hit = rip), partial information and other things. Recently Blizzard shared an interface that makes possible for agents to play the game.
DeepMind is probably the leading research force on Starcraft 2 right now on a professional level.</description>
